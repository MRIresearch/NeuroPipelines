# dicomutils

Code in progress to update patient comments field and route to instance of XNAT.
This is a very naive implementation based on little knowledge using multithreading in python.
Have had to go through a few hoops to make this work with multiprocessing which suggests that for the simple parallel task we are trying to achieve here multithreading is likely to be better.
